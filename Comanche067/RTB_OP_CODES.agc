## Purpose:	A section of Comanche revision 067.
#		It is part of the reconstructed source code for the flight
#		software for the Command Module's (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer
#		(AGC) for Apollo 12. No original listings of this program are
#		available; instead, this file was created via dissassembly of
#		dumps of Comanche 067 core rope modules and comparison with
#		other AGC programs.
