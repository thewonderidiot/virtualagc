# CONSTANT DELTA HEIGHT (CDH) PROGRAMS (P33 AND P73)
# MOD NO -1		LOG SECTION - P32-P35, P72-P75
# MOD BY WHITE.P	DATE  1 JUNE 67
#
# PURPOSE
#
#	(1) TO CALCULATE PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTANT DELTA
#	    ALTITUDE MANEUVER (CDH).
#
#	(2) TO CALCULATE THESE PARAMETERS BASED UPON MANEUVER DATA
#	    APPROVED AND KEYED INTO THE DSKY BY THE ASTRONAUT.
#
#	(3) TO DISPLAY TO THE ASTRONAUT AND THE GROUND DEPENDENT VARIABLES
#	    ASSOCIATED WITH THE CDH MANEUVER FOR APPROVAL BY THE
#	    ASTRONAUT/GROUND.
#
#	(4) TO STORE THE CDH TARGET PARAMETERS FOR USE BY THE DESIRED
#	    THRUSTING PROGRAM.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS
#
#	(1) THIS PROGRAM IS BASED UPON PREVIOUS COMPLETION OF THE
#	    CO-ELLIPTIC SEQUENCE INITIATION (CSI) PROGRAM (P32/P72).
#	    THERFORE -
#
#		(A) AT A SELECTED TPI TIME (NOW IN STORAGE) THE LINE OF SIGHT
#		    BETWEEN THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VEHICLES WAS SELECTED TO BE
#		    A PRESCRIBED ANGLE (E) (NOW IN STORAGE) FROM THE
#		    HORIZONTAL PLANE DEFINED BY THE ACTIVE VEHICLE POSITION.
#
#		(B) THE TIME BETWEEN CSI IGNITION AND CDH IGNITION WAS
#		    COMPUTED TO BE GREATER THAN 10 MINUTES.
#
#		(C) THE TIME BETWEEN CDH IGNITION AND TPI IGNITION WAS
#		    COMPUTED TO BE GREATER THAN 10 MINUTES.
#
#		(D) THE VARIATION OF THE ALTITUDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
#		    ORBITS WAS MINMIZED.
#
#		(E) CSI BURN WAS DEFINED SUCH THAT THE IMPULSIVE DELTA V WAS
#		    IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE DEFINED BY ACTIVE VEHICLE
#		    POSITION AT CSI IGNITION.
#
#		(F) THE PERICENTER ALTITUDES OF THE ORBITS FOLLOWING CSI AND
#		    CDH WERE COMPUTED TO BE GREATER THAN 35,000 FT FOR LUNAR
#		    ORBIT OR 85 NM FOR EARTH ORBIT.
#
#		(G) THE CSI AND CDH MANEUVERS WERE ASSUMED TO BE PARALLEL TO
#		    THE PLANE OF THE PASSIVE VEHICLE ORBIT.  HOWEVER, CREW
#		    MODIFICATION OF DELTA V (LV) COMPONENTS MAY HAVE RESULTED
#		    IN AN OUT-OF-PLANE MANEUVER.
#
#	(2) STATE VECTOR UPDATES BY P27 ARE DISALLOWED DURING AUTOMATIC
#	    STATE VECTOR UPDATING INITIATED BY P20 (SEE ASSUMPTION 4).
#
#	(3) COMPUTED VARIABLES MAY BE STORED FOR LATER VERIFICATION BY
#	    THE GROUND.  THESE STORAGE CAPABILITES ARE NORMALLY LIMITED
#	    ONLY TO THE PARAMETERS FOR ONE THRUSTING MANEUVER AT A TIME
#	    EXCEPT FOR CONCENTRIC FLIGHT PLAN MANEUVER SEQUENCES.
#
#	(4) THE RENDEZVOUS RADAR MAY OR MAY NOT BE USED TO UPDATE THE LM
#	    OR CSM STATE VECTORS FOR THIS PROGRAM.  IF RADAR USE IS
#	    DESIRED THE RADAR WAS TURNED ON AND LOCKED ON THE CSM BY
#	    PREVIOUS SELECTION OF P20.  RADAR SIGHTING MARKS WILL BE MADE
#	    AUTOMATICALLY APPROXIMATELY ONCE A MINUTE WHEN ENABLED BY THE
#	    TRACK AND UPDATE FLAGS (SEE P20).  THE RENDEZVOUS TRACKING
#	    MARK COUNTER IS ZEROED BY THE SELECTION OF P20 AND AFTER EACH
#	    THRUSTING MANEUVER.
#
#	(5) THE ISS NEED NOT BE ON TO COMPLETE THIS PROGRAM.
#
#	(6) THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM UTILIZES THE FOLLOWING FLAGS -
#
#		ACTIVE VEGICLE FLAG - DESIGNATES THE VEHICLE WHICH IS
#		DOING RENDEZVOUS THRUSTING MANEUVERS TO THE PROGRAM WHICH
#		CALCULATES THE MANEUVER PARAMETERS.  SET AT THE START OF
#		EACH RENDEZVOUS PRE-THRUSTING PROGRAM.
#
#		FINAL FLAG - SELECTS FINAL PROGRAM DISPLAYS AFTER CREW HAS
#		COMPLETED THE FINAL MANEUVER COMPUTATION AND DISPLAY
#		CYCLE.
#
#		EXTERNAL DELTA V STEERING FLAG - DESIGNATES THE TYPE OF
#		STEERING REQUIRED FOR EXECUTION OF THIS MANEUVER BY THE
#		THRUSTING PROGRAM SELECTED AFTER COMPLETION OF THIS
#		PROGRAM.
#
#	(7) IT IS NORMALLY REQUIRED THAT THE ISS BE ON FOR 1 HOUR PRIOR TO
#	    A THRUSTING MANEUVER.
#
#	(8) THIS PROGRAM IS SELECTED BY THE ASTRONAUT BY DSKY ENTRY -
#
#		P33 IF THIS VEHICLE IS ACTIVE VEHICLE.
#
#		P73 IF THIS VEHICLE IS PASSIVE VEHICLE.
