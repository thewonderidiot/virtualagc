# PROGRAM NAME     -     SXTMARK
#
# MOD. 1	8 AUG. 69	BY P.RYE
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#
#	SXTMARK IS CALLED BY P03 AND BY P22, P23, P51, AND P52 VIA R53.
#	THE REGISTER MARKINDX IS SET TO 5 IF THE CALLING PROGRAM IS P22, OR TO 1 FOR OTHER USERS.
#	   THIS REGISTER INDICATES THE NUMBER OF MARKS DESIRED.
#	THE REGISTER EXTVBACT IS CHECKED (SUBROUTINE TESTMARK) TO INSURE THAT THE MARK DISPLAY SYSTEM
#	   IS FREE.  IF NOT, BAILOUT (31211) IS DONE.
#	BIT 2 OF THE REGISTER EXTVBACT IS SET BY SXTMARK, RESERVING THE MARKING AND EXTENDED VERB SYSTEM.
#	SXTMARK DISPLAYS A FLASHING VERB 51, CALLING FOR MARKS.  A PROCEED RESPONSE TO THIS DISPLAY
#	   WILL RELEASE THE MARKING SYSTEM (SUBROUTINES MKRELEAS, CLEARMARK) AND RETURN TO THE
#	   CALLING PROGRAM.
#
#	WHEN SUFFICIENT MARKS HAVE BEEN MADE (MARKINDX = 0) A FLASHING V50N25, R1 = 16, IS DISPLAYED.
#	   A PROCEED RESPONSE TO THIS DISPLAY WILL RETURN TO THE CALLING PROGRAM AFTER RELEASING THE
#	   MARKING SYSTEM.
#
#	MARKS ARE PROCESSED BY THE ROUTINE MARKRUPT AS FOLLOWS:
#		IF NO MARKS ARE CALLED FOR, ALARM CODE 114 IS SENT AND THE MARKRUPT ROUTINE EXITS.
#		IF A MARK IS ACCEPTED, MARKFLG IS SET TO ENABLE A REJECT.
#		IF R21(P20) IS RUNNING, DATA IS MOVED FROM STORAGE MRKBUF1 INTO MRKBUF2.  NEW MARK DATA
#			IS STORED INTO MRKBUF1.
#		IF P22 IS RUNNING, MARK DATA IS STORED INTO SVMRKDAT, USING THE REGISTER P22DEX AS AN
#			INDEX AND THE REGISTER 8NN AS A COUNTER.  MARKINDX IS DECREMENTED.
#		IF R57 IS RUNNING, MARK DATA IS STORED INTO MARKDOWN FOR DOWNLINK, THEN PROCESSED AS FOR
#			R21.  MARKRUPT THEN CALLS MARKDISP (IN R57).
#		FOR OTHER USERS, MARK DATA IS STORED INTO MRKBUF1 AND MARKINDX IS DECREMENTED.
#
#	MARK REJECTS ARE PROCESSED BY THE ROUTINE MARKRUPT AS FOLLOWS:
#		IF MARKFLG IS CLEAR (I.E., NO MARK WAS TAKEN), ALARM CODE 110 IS SENT AND THE ROUTINE EXITS.
#		OTHERWISE, MARKINDX IS INCREMENTED, THE P22 INDICATORS 8NN AND P22DEX ARE DECREMENTED
#			(IF THE USER IS P22), AND THE V51FL DISPLAY IN SXTMARK IS REESTABLISHED.
#
#	IF THE ERASABLE REGISTER CDUCHKWD IS SET TO A NON-ZERO VALUE, VALIDITY OF THE MARKS IS CHECKED
#	   BY THE MARKRUPT ROUTINE AS FOLLOWS:
#		IF THE CDU'S CHANGE BY MORE THAN 3 BITS OVER THE TIME PERIOD INDICATED BY THE VALUE OF
#			CDUCHKWD, ALARM CODE 121 IS SENT AND THE ROUTINE EXITS.

# CALLING SEQUENCE -
#
#	TC	BANKCALL
#	CADR	SXTMARK
#


# NORMAL EXIT MODE -
#
#	RETURN TO USER VIA BANKJUMP (RETURN ADDRESS IN OPTCADR).
#
#
# ALARM OR ABORT EXIT MODES
#
#	1. ALARM 110 - MARK REJECT WITH NO MARK
#	2. ALARM 113 - NO INBITS
#	3. ALARM 121 - CDU'S NO GOOD AT MARK TIME
#	4. ALARM 114 - MARK MADE BUT NOT DESIRED
#	5. BAILOUT 31211 - MARK DISPLAY SYSTEM BUSY
#
#
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED -
#
#	NONE
#
#
# OUTPUT -
#
#	FOR P22:
#		MARK DATA IN SVMRKDAT
#		MARKINDX DECREMENTED BY ONE FOR EACH MARK TAKEN
#		NO. OF MARKS IN 8NN
#	FOR R57:
#		MARK DATA IN MARKDOWN AND MRKBUF1
#	FOR OTHER USERS:
#		MARKINDX DECREMENTED TO ZERO IF A MARK WAS TAKEN
#		MARK DATA IN MRKBUF1
#
#
# CONDITIONS AT EXIT -
#
#	MARKINDX = INITIAL VALUE - NO. MARKS TAKEN
#	MARKING SYSTEM IS RELEASED :
#		EXTVBACT = 0
#		BIT 9 OPTMODES = 0
#		OPTIND = -1
#		BIT 2 CHAN12 = 0
#	MARKFLG = 0
